# Triangles

This package is an attempt to take commonly used triangle functions and make them easily usable.

This diagram will serve for understanding some of the code related letter reference.

For now assume 90 degree angle at point `b`.

C = is the hypotenuse always

a = acos(A/C)
b = 90
c = acos(B/C)
